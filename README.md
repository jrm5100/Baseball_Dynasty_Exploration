Tell Stories with with Data Visualization

# Summary
This data comes from Lahman's Baseball Database and includes various team statistics.  The first graph displays one statistic for active franchises going back to 1876. The second graph displays two statistics in a scatterplot for the selected year.  Some statistics seem to have clear patterns, such as the drop in offense (runs) in the last decade or so.

# Design
This was designed to be an exploratory visualization, but with an initial explanatory view.  This way a narrative can be conveyed, with plenty of flexibility for further exploration.
